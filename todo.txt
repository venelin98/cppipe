description - advantages over manual compile
man
tips (sigaction SIGCHILD, SIG_IGN, SIG_DFL)
 - redirected processes block if their output is not read
make sure file descriptors are closed when no longer used
cppipe compile options from tft
respect CXXFLAGS LDFLAGS

optional exec
std::string args
args before src file go to compiler
use exceptions (open_or_die)
throw when a command couldnt be ran
precompiled header cppipe.h
-Wno-unused-result in install.sh
file operations, lack of uniformity (C++ vs POSIX)
Check all return codes and report errors
